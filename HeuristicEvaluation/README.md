## Project Description

## Severity Ratings For Usability Problems - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
Each usability problem is rated using a scale based off the Nielson Norman Group severity rating scale for usability problems. These ratings take into account the **frequency** of the problem's occurance, the **impact** of the problem on the user, and the **persistence** of the problem throughout the user's process.
| Severity Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No Issues: well designed features |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor Usability Problem: low priority to fix |
| 3 | Major Usability Problem; top priority to fix |

Formosi is a boutique PR and marketing agency specializing in the beauty and wellness industry. Formosi utilizes a number of business and marketing tactics to specifically target potential customers in the local areas of each client. These services include but are not limited to social media management and content creation, personal referral and voucher campaigns, and strategic interpersonal marketing approaches. The website primarily highlights the "About" section to inform users of Formosi's process and focus. In addition, information is displayed about some of their services and current clientele. 

The website is relatively minimalist in presentation of information, ensuring the user is not overstimulated or distracted. However, I believe the website could implement changes to improve the usability of the site, as well as the general flow of information. The system primarily lacks in areas involving visibility of system status, match between system + world, and consistency and standards. There are a few errors in feedback and communication of affordances as well as lack of proper signifiers throughout the page--this makes it more difficult for users to access the desired information. In addition, the system doesn't tend to present information in a logical or standard flow. Many of the important elements are hidden in redirected pages while the rest is present in a linear single page layout. Finally, the system is inconsistent in redirection functions and fonts/colors. 

## 1. Visibility of System Status
### The system should always keep users informed about what is going on through efficient feedback.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Top categories are visible at all times from all pages/sections of a page. | N/A |  
| 2 | The services pages redirect rather than remaining on the original home page like the remainder of the sections. Once redirected, the feedback to inform the user that they are viewing a service, as well as an indicator of how to view other services, is not consistently visible to the user. | The "Services" text and/or cell should be highlighted and visible to the user. |  
| 3 | The top menu bar appears to highlight the current section that you are viewing (beginning with Home), however it does not properly change to "About", "Services", etc. as you scroll downward to view different sections. | Reprogram/recalibrate the page to contain the accurate information. | <br/>

## 2. Match Between System + Real World
### The system should speak the user's langugage, use familiar concepts rather than system-oriented language, and make information appear in a natural + logical order.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | System's language is generally familiar, however it can be more unclear in terms of the services. Terms such as "vouchers campaigns" are used but not elaborated upon. It is difficult to tell what these services consist of. | Services, marketing techniques, etc. should be clearly defined and communicate the details that they entail. |  
| 3 | Information is not presented in a natural order. Services should be the top priority, however the two services are split up on the main page into the second and seventh section. The "brand experience" section is displayed above the "Community" title. | Reorganization of the content to flow more coherently. | <br/>

## 3. User Control and Freedom
### Should contain clearly marked exits that allow users to leave unwanted states. Helpful in the common occurance of navigation slips and mistakes. Should support undo and redo, and limit the amount of extended dialogue. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |  
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 3 | Once the user has been redirected to the Services page, there isn't a great way to return to the Voucher and Social Media Marketing content on the main home page. The only way is to direct ot the "About" or "Community" sections and scroll up or down. | System should act similarly to the "Community" section -- "Learn More" redirects to a different page, but the main home page content can still be accessed by clicking the "Community" tab. | <br/>

## 4. Consistency and Standards
### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Common functions, symbols, etc. that are utilized in the system (as well as in other systems) should be consistent.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Images in the "Our Community" section of the home page are horizontally scrollable, however there are no signifiers to indicate this. | Add arrow icons and dots along the bottom to represent the currently viewed image. |  
| 1 | Backgrounds and text placement of the customer reviews are not consistent. | Make sure they are all equally formatted. |  
| 1 | There are many elements that an average user would think would be clickable based on their experience with other systems. For example, "Blog," "Privacy Policy," and "Terms of Service" are not clickable. Images in the "Our Community" section are clickable but display the text "an image title." | While it is clear that these sections have just not been developed yet, for professional purposes it is better to leave them out altogether until they are finalized and functional. |  
| 2 | "The Formosi Impact" is hidden within the redirected Voucher Campaign page. Unclear whether this impact is specific to the voucher campaigns only, or relevant to all services. | Redefine "The Formosi Impact" or relocate it to convey proper information. | 
| 3 | Text size and color are not consistent for titles. For example, in the sections talking about voucher campaigns and social media marketing (two primary services), "Voucher Campaigns" is bolded, orange, and appears to be the title. In contrast, "Where to Start" is boded, orange, and appears to be the title, rather than "Social Media Marketing." This leaves a lot of room for confusion about what is and isn't considered a primary service. | Make fonts and colors consistent for related information, services, etc. | <br/>

## 5. Error Prevention
### System should implement a careful design that prevents a problem from occuring in the first place. Rather than simply displaying an error message, system should eliminate error prone conditions, constantly check for errors, and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to an action.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | For the most part, Formosi.com does not leave much room for error. There is not a lot of user input required, and the buttons to continue processes (i.e. "Learn More") clearly communicate that you will be moving to the next step. | N/A |
| 0 | Links for other sites (e.g. social media) open in a new tab rather than the same tab. | N/A |
| 2 | One concern is that all "contact us" buttons redriect to a general form at the bottom of the page. This leave little direction for the user to specify their needs and could lead to miscommunication. | A simple suggestion would be to have a more elaborate contact form that suggests categories or topics to be discussed. This would inform the user about what type of conversation to expect. |
| 2 | When attempting to submit an empty contact form, only the email and subject are required. This leaves room for the possibility of a user accidentally submitting a form early. | Make the content of the message required rather than the subject (similar to an email) | <br/>

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
### Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not be required to memorize information. Instructions should be visible, easily accessible, and intuitive. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | There isn't much room for error in terms of recall. The website is primarily information based and does not require memorization. One slight concern would be that the website utilizes a lot of trendy/modernistic terms that can require to user to infer information. In other words, the user may essentially have to memorize connotations. | Use simpler but meaningful terms such as "establish a community" rather than trendy terms like "local love." A few instances are fine but do not want to overdo it. | <br/>

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
### Make accelerators hidden for novices but available for experts. Allows users to tailor frequent actions. 
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | CEO noted that there were a lot of services that current clients didn't know about. Website should display the basic and most important information, but still provide access to more detailed information if the user wishes to dive deeper. | There could be more information with examples of previous work, testimonials, media mentions, etc. | <br/>

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
### The layout and presentation of information should be easy on the eye and only highlight important points.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Should avoid distracting and unnecessary features like swirl transitions for the mission statement. Can be distracting. | Use a simple transition like a blend or no transition at all. | 
| 1 | Very minimal, but the customer review section transitions way too quickly. Not nearly enough time to read the testimonials/reviews. | Slow it down. | 
| 2 | As previously mentioned, the titles, word choice, and a order of information can use some work to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly layout. However, in addition, a redesign in color choice should be considered. It's commonly suggested to stay away from dark colors when mixed media is present. For example, the website currently contains a lot of other colors such as orange, teal, and white as well as images of people and places that contain a lot of textures, color, and depth. The switch between all these colors can be distracting. | Might be best to stick with white, especially when paired with photos. |
| 2 | Eye tracking user research has shown that people's eyes will always focus the most of bold text and faces. This means these can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on the context. The system utilizes a lot of large stock-like images that can be distracting to look at, especially when it is unclear how they are related to the content of the page. | Some pages such as the social media marketing page contain solely images of people as the focus. These can be replaced with photos more relevant to the content or more minimalistic and aesthetic images. | <br/>

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
### Error messages should be expressed in simple langugage, precisely identify the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Very little room for error messages. The one that does occur (contact form) utilizes clear indications of a mistake. Boxes are highlighted in red if they are missing but required. | N/A | <br/>

## 10. Help and Documentation
### Help should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. For example, the help and FAQ should be easily found and accessible.
| Rating | Evaluation | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | There is no FAQ, search bar, "Contact us for help", etc. within the website. | There should be a way for users to search for information or keywords as well as access a help page. An FAQ is also very helpful for a site dedicated to providing services. Something like a PR/marketing agency that requires a lot of information and evidence of reliability/success should definitely have a simplified version of this information (in the form of an FAQ can be intuitive and helpful) | <br/>
